## Research Module in Econometrics and Statistics

This repository presents the final project of Research Module in Econometrics and Statistics.

The purpose of [our project](https://github.com/JieunKim-Econ/RM_DID/blob/main/Compact%20Review%20of%20DID.pdf) is to provide the comprehensive understanding of the DID method
by giving the compact review, from the model description to empirical application with Monte
Carlo simulation. 

For the empirical application of the DID method, we replicate the paper,
"Do police reduce crime?" by Di Tella and Schargrodsky (2004), where the authors employ a
DID approach to answer the question of whether the street presence of police reduces car thefts.
While our replication confirms the main results of the police deterrence effect, we extend our
analysis with [Monte Carlo simulation](https://github.com/JieunKim-Econ/RM_DID/blob/main/Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.R). We examine our parameter estimators under four different
specifications with inclusion or exclusion of month and block fixed effects. Furthermore, we
look into the case where the key assumption of DID, the parallel trend, does not hold.
